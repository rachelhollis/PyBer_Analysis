# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis was to use data provided from a ridesharing company called PyBer, to uncover trends and patterns. Two datasets containing ride and city data were used to separate the data in relation to different city types. A multiple-line graph was created using Python with Matplotlib to visually summarize the total weekly fares for each type of city in a clear and comprehensive way.

### Purpose

Calculate the following metrics for analysis

- Total rides per city type
- Total drivers per city type
- Total fares per city type
- Average fare per ride for each city type
- Average fare per driver for each city type
- A summary DataFrame of the previous obtained data
- Multiple line plot to show the total weekly fares for each type of city
